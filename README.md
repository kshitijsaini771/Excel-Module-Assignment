## Overview

This project enables me to apply Excel concepts in a practical, real-world context. It allows me to develop end-to-end analytical solutions—ranging from data cleaning and exploratory analysis to dynamic visualization—culminating in interactive dashboards that deliver clear, data-driven insights to support informed business decision-making.

## Dataset

This project leverages the widely recognized **Sample Superstore Sales dataset**, a simulated business dataset that models sales, profit, and customer transaction data for a fictional global retail organization. The dataset can be downloaded directly from the official source: [Sample Superstore Sales Excel File](https://community.tableau.com/s/question/0D54T00000CWeX8SAL/sample-superstore-sales-excelxls). It is structured as a multi-sheet Excel workbook (`.xls`), with three core interrelated tables—**Orders**, **Returns**, and **People**—that collectively support comprehensive end-to-end analysis. The data spans four fiscal years (2014–2017) and covers sales activity across the **United States**, segmented into four geographic regions. Each transaction record includes a rich set of attributes: customer information (e.g., name and segment), product details (category, sub-category, and product name), granular location data (country, region, state, city, and postal code), key performance metrics (sales, quantity, discount, and profit), and order-specific fields such as order date, ship date, shipping mode, and unique order identifiers. This depth and structure make the dataset ideal for exploring business performance, customer behavior, and operational efficiency.

## Analysis Outcome

- This project was designed to develop and demonstrate foundational to intermediate Excel competencies through practical application on the Sample Superstore dataset.

- **Essential Functions:** Gained proficiency with core formulas such as `SUM`, `MAX`/`MIN`, various `COUNT` functions, and `POWER` for calculating growth rates and aggregations.

- **Data Presentation:** Enhanced readability by applying `TRANSPOSE` for layout adjustments and mastering formatting techniques for cells, numbers, and text.

- **Data Organization:** Implemented multi-level sorting and advanced filtering—by values, text content, and even cell color—to structure datasets logically.

- **Date & Logical Operations:** Performed date-based computations using `DATEDIF` and `TODAY`, and built decision logic with `IF`, `AND`, `OR`, and error-handling via `IFERROR`.

- **Data Cleaning Techniques:** Executed comprehensive data cleansing using `TRIM`, `PROPER`, `TEXT TO COLUMNS`, `FIND & REPLACE`, and the `Go To Special` feature to resolve duplicates, inconsistencies, and textual errors.

- **Analytical Summarization:** Constructed and customized **PivotTables** to dynamically summarize sales data, group time periods, and apply conditional formatting for visual insights.

- **Cross-Table Data Integration:** Leveraged `VLOOKUP` and `HLOOKUP` to retrieve and align related information across different sheets or tables.

- **Criteria-Based Calculations:** Utilized `SUMIFS`, `COUNTIFS`, and `AVERAGEIF` to generate precise metrics based on single or multiple conditions.

- Through these tasks, raw transactional data was transformed into a clean, insightful, and professionally formatted dataset—strengthening my capability to use Excel effectively for business analysis and reporting.
