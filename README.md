## **Overview**

This project helps me apply Excel concepts practically. I can build end-to-end Excel solutions by cleaning, analyzing, and visualizing data to create interactive dashboards that provide clear, actionable business insights.


## **Dataset for Analysis**

The project uses the widely-used **Sample Superstore Sales dataset**, a business dataset that simulates sales, profit, and customer data for a global retail chain.

**You can download the dataset directly via this link:**  
**[Sample Superstore Sales Excel File](https://community.tableau.com/s/question/0D54T00000CWeX8SAL/sample-superstore-sales-excelxls)**

**Dataset Overview:**
*   **Structure:** The file is an Excel workbook (`.xls`) with multiple sheets that contain interrelated data.
*   **Key Tables:** The main tables are **Orders**, **Returns**, and **People**. These can be linked to perform a complete analysis.
*   **Data Scope:** It includes four years of transaction data from 2014 to 2017 across the **United States**, divided into four regions.
*   **Rich Attributes:** Each record has detailed dimensions and metrics, such as:
    *   **Customer Details:** Customer Name, Segment.
    *   **Product Information:** Category, Sub-Category, Product Name.
    *   **Geographic Data:** Country, Region, State, City, Postal Code.
    *   **Sales Metrics:** Sales, Quantity, Discount, Profit.
    *   **Order Details:** Order Date, Ship Date, Ship Mode, Order ID.

## **Analysis**

> Solution File is `Sample - Superstore - Solution.xlsx`

This project aimed to build and showcase basic to intermediate Excel skills through hands-on tasks with the Sample Superstore dataset which included:

*   **Core Operations:** Learned key functions like `SUM`, `MAX/MIN`, `COUNT` variants, and `POWER` for growth calculations.
*   **Data Structuring:** Used `TRANSPOSE` and practiced various techniques for cell, number, and text formatting to improve clarity.
*   **Data Organization:** Applied multi-level sorting and filtering, including by values, text, and cell color.
*   **Date & Logic:** Performed date calculations (`DATEDIF`, `TODAY`) and included logical tests with `IF`, `AND`, `OR`, and `IFERROR`.
*   **Data Cleaning:** Carried out thorough cleaning using `TRIM`, `PROPER`, `TEXT TO COLUMNS`, `FIND & REPLACE`, and the `Go To Special` feature to manage duplicates, errors, and inconsistent text.
*   **Data Analysis:** Created and customized **Pivot Tables** for dynamic summarization, grouping, and conditional formatting.
*   **Data Lookup & Matching:** Used `VLOOKUP`/`HLOOKUP` for data retrieval and comparison across tables.
*   **Conditional Aggregation:** Applied `SUMIFS`, `COUNTIFS`, and `AVERAGEIF` to perform calculations based on single and multiple criteria.

This exercise transformed raw sales data into a clean, analyzed, and well-presented dataset, reinforcing my ability to use Excel as an effective tool for business intelligence and reporting.

## **Dashboard Summary**

This interactive dashboard provides a complete view of sales, profit, and product performance over several years.

**Key Performance Indicators (KPIs):**
*   **Total Sales:** **¥2.29M**; **Total Profit:** **¥286K**.
*   **Product Breadth:** Covers **17 Sub-Categories** with **9994 units** sold.
*   **Category Split:** Sales are divided among **Furniture, Office Supplies** and **Technology**.

**Visualizations & Insights:**
*   **Sales by Sub-Category:** A detailed breakdown shows top-performing items like **Copiers, Phones** and **Chairs**, along with low-margin categories.
*   **Segment & Region Analysis:** A stacked bar chart shows that the **Consumer segment** leads sales in all regions; the **West** is the top market.
*   **Top 10 Products:** Highlights specific high-revenue items like **Canon imageCLASS Copiers** and **Cisco TelePresence Systems**.
*   **Discount Impact:** A critical view shows how discount percentages influence sales volume across various customer segments.
*   **Sales Trend:** A line chart tracks monthly sales and profit over time; it reveals seasonal peaks, such as in November, and troughs.

This dashboard helps quickly identify revenue drivers, profitability by category, regional opportunities, and the effect of promotional strategies.

    *   **Review KPIs:** Start by looking at the high-level metrics at the top: **Total Sales, Total Profit, and Quantity Sold**.
    *   **Apply Filters:** Use the interactive slicers, such as **Year** and **Category**, to filter the entire dashboard. For example, select **"2015"** or **"Technology"** to view performance for that specific year or category.
    *   **Analyze Charts:** Click on or hover over any chart element. Clicking a segment in the **"Sales by Sub-Category"** chart can filter other visuals. Hovering reveals exact values and percentages.

3.  **Refresh Data (If Applicable):**
    *   If the workbook is linked to an updated dataset, refresh the analysis by going to the **Data** tab and selecting **"Refresh All."**
