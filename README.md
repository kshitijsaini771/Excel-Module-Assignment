# Excel Analytics & Dashboard (Sample Superstore)

## Problem Statement
Excel remains a core tool for business analysis, yet many analysts struggle to move from basic formulas to **end-to-end analytical workflows**. This project applies Excel to the **Sample Superstore Sales** dataset to practice and demonstrate skills in data cleaning, exploration, and dynamic reporting—culminating in an interactive sales performance dashboard for decision-makers.

## Analysis Done
- Worked with the **Sample Superstore Sales** Excel workbook containing **Orders, Returns, and People** tables, covering U.S. retail sales from 2014–2017.
- Strengthened core Excel skills:
  - **Essential functions:** `SUM`, `MIN`/`MAX`, `COUNT` variants, and `POWER` for aggregations and growth-rate calculations.
  - **Presentation & formatting:** Used `TRANSPOSE`, custom number formats, and cell styling to make reports clearer and more readable.
- Organized and cleaned data:
  - Applied **multi-level sorting** and **advanced filters** (by values, text, and color) for structured views.
  - Performed data cleaning using `TRIM`, `PROPER`, **Text to Columns**, **Find & Replace**, and **Go To Special`** to address duplicates, spacing, and text issues.
- Built analysis logic:
  - Used `DATEDIF` and `TODAY` for date calculations and time-based metrics.
  - Created conditional logic with `IF`, `AND`, `OR`, and wrapped calculations with `IFERROR` for robust formulas.
- Performed business analysis:
  - Built **PivotTables** to summarize sales and profit by category, segment, region, and time period.
  - Joined information across sheets using `VLOOKUP`/`HLOOKUP` where needed.
  - Calculated conditional metrics using `SUMIFS`, `COUNTIFS`, and `AVERAGEIF` for targeted performance insights.
- Overall, raw transactional data was transformed into a clean, structured, and analysis-ready dataset fully driven by Excel features.

## Recommendations
- **Focus on high-value sub-categories:** Prioritize inventory and promotions for top performers like Tables, Chairs, and leading technology products.
- **Optimize discount strategy:** Use discount vs. sales visuals to reduce over-discounting in segments where profit margins are already tight.
- **Leverage regional strengths:** Invest in marketing and service in regions and segments showing strong growth, while diagnosing weak regions through deeper drill-downs.
- **Monitor category and time trends:** Use the dashboard regularly to track monthly performance and adjust tactics ahead of peak or low-demand periods.
